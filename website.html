                        <br>
                        In the ever-evolving landscape of web development and hosting, deploying a
                        personal website can often traverse through complex and intriguing paths. My recent adventure in
                        launching my own website is a testament to the myriad of possibilities that cloud technologies
                        offer, albeit with an overcomplicated flair that could rival one of Rube Goldberg's
                        contraptions. Let's
                        delve into the intricacies of hosting a static site on AWS, using services such as
                        S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, and a sprinkle of GitHub Actions magic.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The cornerstone of this digital architecture is the AWS S3 bucket, renowned for its simplicity
                        and reliability. I decided to serve the website through CloudFront,
                        AWS's content delivery network,
                        to reduce latency and improve load times for users across the globe.
                        To seamlessly incorporate an RSS feed from cyware.com and mitigate CORS errors, I implemented an
                        AWS HTTP API Gateway to act as a backend proxy. This HTTP endpoint works as a bridge, fetching
                        the RSS feed from a server (as opposed to a client browser) and
                        presenting it as if it were a native component of the site, thereby circumventing any CORS
                        limitations.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <a href="assets/img/website-diagram-dark.png"><img src="assets/img/website-diagram-dark.png"
                                class="blog-image"></a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The quest for automation and seamless updates led me down the path of
                        integrating GitHub Actions into the workflow. Each push to the master branch
                        triggers a series of actions that programmatically update the contents of the S3
                        bucket. Furthermore, the
                        CloudFront distribution cache is invalidated, forcing it to fetch and distribute the newest
                        content.
                        Here is the <code> deploy-site.yaml</code> file that runs the CI pipeline:
                        <pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Deploy to AWS S3 and Invalidate CloudFront

    push:

                        </p>
                    <p>Even though I injected complexity by implementing a cloud-based, declarative, highly-available architecture, 
                        I still haven't touched a single JS framework; the whole codebase is simple HTML, CSS and javascript. 
                        Maybe one day I'll learn React, Vue, or Svelte... maybe even JQuery... but not today.
